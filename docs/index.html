      <h1>Scope of Project</h1>
      <div>
        <p> Residents of Portland and South Portland in Maine have been reporting disruptive smells in the air
          on certain days of the year.
          South Portland has over 25,500 residents, and is the host of oil, gasoline, and asphalt tanks.
          These tanks do not have emissions controls and the emissions, in the form of odors,
          are reported in both South Portland and Portland.
          Many of the emissions are odorless and toxic, and may or may not correlate with odor complaints.
          It's been unclear what the source of the smells might be and difficult to understand the extent of the
          issue on both sides of the Fore River, which separates Portland and South Portland.

          The City of South Portland relies on <a href="https://smellmycity.org/">Smell My City</a> for odor complaints,
          while Portland relies on <a href="https://seeclickfix.com/portland_2">See Click Fix<a />.
            The Department of Environmental Protection has <a
              href="https://www.maine.gov/dep/air/monitoring/spo-sampling-results.html">0 VOC Canister Monitors<a />
              (volatile organic compounds) in Portland and South Portland.
              The tanks are considered <a href="https://www.maine.gov/dep/air/permits/minor.html">minor sources of air
                emissions<a />,
                and regulated accordingly.

      <h1>Why is Controlling Malodour Important?</h1>
      <div>
        <p>Odour can be defined as a mixture of gases in the air that we can smell, which can both be pleasant or
          unpleasant smells (Victoria, 2020). Odour pollution refers to these unpleasant smells, which although can
          simple be unpleasant, it can have other risks associated with it. Milder negative externalities include
          feelings of duscodt or discomfort, which can lead to headaches, nausea, vomiting and also behavioural changes.
          (Shukla, 1991) It has been proven that our sense of smell gives a startling fast response to potentially
          dangerous situations, jerking us away from the stench and less willing to be in the source area as much
          (Genter, 2019). The surrounding houses and businesses have the potential of being greatly impacted if nobody
          wants to go around that area. More serious health effects can occur when the negative smells are also toxic in
          its nature, particularly to the respiratory system. Soot and dust are common smells that are cancerous and can
          damage our lungs and have a knock on effect on our body (Niranjan, 2017).</p>

      <h1>Language Analysis</h1>
      <div>
        <p> With the reporting of the smell, the citizen can also describe the smell. Here, the most used words to describe the malodour were put together to get a better understand of what kinds of smells were most critical. Industrial smells, mainly oil and asphalt were smelled, as can be seen by the graph.</p>

        <div>
        <p> The H1 - High industrial areas in Portland seem to have a correleation to the source of the smells. There seem to be three main clusters of 'stinky' data: the north-most is in the R-4 zoning, which classfies as residential. It borders more residential (R-6) and ROS (recreation open source) zoning.

The clusters around South Portland are also in residential areas (A, G) but with neighbouring commerical (C) and limited business zoning (LB).
          
          Given the zoning, the smells to be affecting mostly households and community spaces, even though the smells are industrial.
