  <h1>Scope of Project</h1>
      <div>
        <p> Residents of Portland and South Portland in Maine have been reporting disruptive smells in the air
on certain days of the year.
South Portland has over 25,500 residents, and is the host of oil, gasoline, and asphalt tanks.
These tanks do not have emissions controls and the emissions, in the form of odors,
are reported in both South Portland and Portland.
Many of the emissions are odorless and toxic, and may or may not correlate with odor complaints.
It's been unclear what the source of the smells might be and difficult to understand the extent of the
issue on both sides of the Fore River, which separates Portland and South Portland.

The City of South Portland relies on <a href="https://smellmycity.org/">Smell My City</a> for odor complaints,
while Portland relies on <a href="https://seeclickfix.com/portland_2">See Click Fix<a/>.
The Department of Environmental Protection has
[9 VOC Canister Monitors](https://www.maine.gov/dep/air/monitoring/spo-sampling-results.html)
(volatile organic compounds) in Portland and South Portland.
The tanks are considered [minor sources of air emissions](https://www.maine.gov/dep/air/permits/minor.html),
and regulated accordingly.

      <h1>Why is Controlling Malodour Important?</h1>
      <div>
        <p>Odour can be defined as a mixture of gases in the air that we can smell, which can both be pleasant or
          unpleasant
          smells (Victoria, 2020). Odour pollution refers to these unpleasant smells, which although can simple be
          unpleasant,
          it can have other risks associated with it. Milder negative externalities include feelings of duscodt or
          discomfort,
          which can lead to headaches, nausea, vomiting and also behavioural changes. (Shukla, 1991) It has been proven
          that
          our sense of smell gives a startling fast response to potentially dangerous situations, jerking us away from
          the
          stench and less willing to be in the source area as much (Genter, 2019). The surrounding houses and businesses
          have
          the potential of being greatly impacted if nobody wants to go around that area.
          More serious health effects can occur when the negative smells are also toxic in its nature, particularly to
          the
          respiratory system. Soot and dust are common smells that are cancerous and can damage our lungs and have a
          knock
          on
          effect on our body (Niranjan, 2017).</p>

      <h1>Language Analysis</h1>
      <div>
        <p>Here, the most used words to describe the malodour were put together to get a better understand of what kind
          of
          smells were most critical.</p>
