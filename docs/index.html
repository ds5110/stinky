<h1>Why is controlling Malodour Important?</h1>
<p>Odour can be defined as a mixture of gases in the air that we can smell, which can both be pleasant or unpleasant smells (Victoria, 2020). Odour pollution refers to these unpleasant smells, which although can simple be unpleasant, it can have other risks associated with it. Milder negative externalities include feelings of duscodt or discomfort, which can lead to headaches, nausea, vomiting and also behavioural changes. (Shukla, 1991) It has been proven that our sense of smell gives a startling fast response to potentially dangerous situations, jerking us away from the stench and less willing to be in the source area as much (Genter, 2019). The surrounding houses and businesses have the potential of being greatly impacted if nobody wants to go around that area.
More serious health effects can occur when the negative smells are also toxic in its nature, particularly to the respiratory system. Soot and dust are common smells that are cancerous and can damage our lungs and have a knock on effect on our body (Niranjan, 2017).</p>
